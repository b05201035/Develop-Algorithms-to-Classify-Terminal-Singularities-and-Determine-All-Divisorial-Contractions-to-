we designed two programs to compute all divisorial contractions to a point $P$ on threefold $X$ with discrepancy $1$. Since the discrepancy of the exceptional divisor of a weight blowup depends only on its weight, we may call a weight an admissible weight if it gives a weight blowup such that its exceptional divisor has discrepancy $1$. Our first strategy, using Hayakawa's work as reference, consists of three parts: finding a highest admissible weighted blowup $\pi_{w_h}:X_{w_h}\to X$, finding all exceptional divisors with discrepancy 1 over $X$ according to the geometry of $X_{w_h}$, and checking whether the weighted blowups corresponding to these exceptional divisors are divisorial contractions. Indeed, all the admissible weights can be solved by linear programming, and the second part can be mainly achieved by economic toric resolutions or explicit computation of resolutions. Both of them are possible to implement on a computer. Moreover, we know that when a weighted blowup will be a divisorial contraction, and the main difficulty of the final part, checking for any $F\in\mathbb{C}[x,y,z,u]$ whether $\{F=0\}$ is terminal or not, has been resolved by our first two algorithms. We also came up with another strategy by comprehensively checking all admissible weighted blowups to determine all divisorial contractions. Lastly, we implemented our algorithms in Sage with Sympy and Singular
